# Practical 1 – OS Simulator


## THEORY (POINTS)
- An operating system controls process creation, scheduling and memory.
- A simulator or command-line tools help us visualize how processes
  change states (new, ready, running, waiting, terminated).
- Commands like `ps`, `top` and `free` show information about
  processes and memory.

## IMPORTANT COMMANDS
ps       – display running processes  
top      – live view of processes and CPU  
free -h  – show total, used and free memory

## RESULT
Thus, various OS functions like process management and memory usage
were observed using simulator/commands.
